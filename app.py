DESCRIPTION = """
To introduce myself to you, I am a third year computer science student at the University of Windsor currently pursuing Bachelor of Computer Science and actively looking for coop opportunities. 
I have started my computer science journey back in 2021 at the highest ranked private university of Bangladesh, infamously known as Independent University, Bangladesh until I transferred to University of Windsor for a better hands-on learning experience. 
As a volunteer in the systems administration position, I am currently working for DEFEND, a tech company known for making technologies that are focused primarily on the authentication systems for the safety of vulnerable people.
Similarly, it has been a great Fall 2023 semester as a teaching assistant for the Data Structure and Algorithms course at the University of Windsor.
Fun fact: I am a big fan of C++ but my projects are based on Python. Personally, I believe I make the best chicken stew and love listening to R&B, soft rock and on weekends I find it cool riding escooter in the middle of the night.
